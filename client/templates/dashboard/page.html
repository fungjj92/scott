    <h2>How to use this site</h2>
    <p>Scott Eustis and Thomas Levine are the main persons who enter data into the site. Everyone can view this entire site and see how the process works, but you need to be logged in to enter data.</p>
    <p>Changes to the data are sent to the server right away. If you aren't sure whether something has been saved, reload the page and check that it matches your expectations.</p>
    <p>If you need an account, email <a href="http://thomaslevine.com">Thomas Levine</a>.</p>
    <h2>Automatic data import</h2>
    <p>
        With this website, you can annotate notices of permit application, but you cannot add
        new notices; a computer does that automatically, and it also takes an initial guess
        at the contents of the public notice.

        are <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/scott-listings">here</a>,
